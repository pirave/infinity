P.s. can you fix this please. I'm really bad at writing crap, lol.


The button class is extended form AxesWidget which is a child class of the abstract class Widget. Widget is a class that displays GUI Widgets. AxesWidget contains several children which include: Button, Slider, CheckButtons, RadioButtons, Cursor, RectangleSelector, LassoSelector and Lasso. Each of these classes has an list of observers implemented in similar fashion as Button. The Button class inherits a list of cid’s from the parent class AxesWidget which stores the callback functions’ unique identifier. This unique id is used for many tasks involving a specific observer. Furthermore, the Button class has an dictionary to store all of the callback functions with its associated cid (in this case they’re the observers). The role that the observers play is to invoke the callback function whenever the button is “_released”. Observers are added by calling the on_clicked function, removed by calling the disconnect function with a specific cid, and the “disconnect_events” function removes all events from the button.
